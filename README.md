The goal is to use Machine Learning to forecast Stock Price. In that purpose, we are comparing different methods, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Polyfit and Deep Learning using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture.
The data set used here can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mattiuzc/stock-exchange-data).
